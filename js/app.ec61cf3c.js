Major advancements in casualty transport and medical procedure occurred during the war. Evacuation by air was initially in the Air Force’s sphere of responsibility as they used large cargo planes to transport patients to the rear. By the start of the Korean War, helicopters or ‘air ambulance’ were introduced and favoured for its quick and relative ease of casualty transportation from the frontlines. The Bell H-13 was the main helicopter used for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) as it was the first certified helicopter. Nicknamed the ‘Angel of Mercy’, the Bell H-13 was responsible for evacuating some 18,000 United Nations casualties (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650) . However, since only two patients at a time could be transported via the skids placed outside each helicopter, this meant that the treatment that each patient received during transport was limited.

Triage was instituted at battalion aid stations which were small medical units that had limited capabilities. These stations were capable of supporting up to 1,000 soldiers. Here, general medical officers and nurses evaluated a soldier’s condition and wound severity. Patients needing surgery and all critical patients were rapidly evacuated to the MASH by helicopter. They were further evaluated based on their hemodynamic status and injury. Injuries deemed most critical were prioritized for surgery (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650 - 651). Owing to the huge casualty influx at most if not all MASH hospitals, there was a need to efficiently allocate resources to where it is needed most. This meant that patients considered to unlikely survive were managed expectantly.

Before the Vietnam War, patients whose conditions were unstable were transfused whole blood. While this was effective in managing the condition for some patients, it was not entirely foolproof. Acute renal failure occurred to 0.5% of frontline casualties and needless to say, such a condition in this rough and unforgiving setting resulted in high mortality rates of about 80% to 90% despite immediate care. To combat this, anesthesiologists started using minute amounts of narcotic for induction. Chloroform and ether were also discontinued as anesthetics as it was found to be detrimental to the patients health due to their negative inotropic effects and replacing chloroform and ether was nitrous oxide used Other anesthesia that was recommended for use by MASH units were Thiopental for induction and Tubocurarine and succinylcholine for rapid intubation. \n        ")])]),a("b-col",{attrs:{cols:"10",offset:"1"}},[a("br"),a("br"),a("table",[a("tr",[a("th",[e._v("U.S. Conflicts")]),a("th",[e._v("Battle Deaths")]),a("th",[e._v("Wounded in Action")]),a("th",[e._v("Died of Wounds")]),a("th",[e._v("Postevacuation Mortality")])]),a("tr",[a("td",[e._v("World War I")]),a("td",[e._v("50,510 (1.2%)")]),a("td",[e._v("193,663 (4.8%)")]),a("td",[e._v("NA")]),a("td",[e._v("8.5%")])]),a("tr",[a("td",[e._v("World War II")]),a("td",[e._v("234,874 (2.0%)")]),a("td",[e._v("565,861 (5%)")]),a("td",[e._v("20,810 (3.7)")]),a("td",[e._v("4.0%")])]),a("tr",[a("td",[e._v("Korean War")]),a("td",[e._v("27,709 (0.98%)")]),a("td",[e._v("77,596 (2.7%)")]),a("td",[e._v("1,887 (2.4%)")]),a("td",{staticStyle:{"background-color":"lightgrey"}},[e._v("2.5%")])])])])],1),a("b-row",[a("b-col",{staticClass:"next-slide-container",attrs:{cols:"8",offset:"2"}},[a("div",{staticClass:"next-slide-text"},[a("h4",[e._v("MASH Living Conditions")]),a("br"),e._v("\n\n          The popular 1970s M*A*S*H television series was based off Richard Hooker's experience during his time as a surgeon in the Korean War.
