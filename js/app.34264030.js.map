Major advancements in casualty transport and medical procedure occurred during the war. Evacuation by air was initially in the Air Force’s sphere of responsibility as they used large cargo planes to transport patients to the rear. By the start of the Korean War, helicopters or ‘air ambulance’ were introduced and favoured for its quick and relative ease of casualty transportation from the frontlines. The Bell H-13 was the main helicopter used for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) as it was the first certified helicopter. Nicknamed the ‘Angel of Mercy’, the Bell H-13 was responsible for evacuating some 18,000 United Nations casualties (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650) . However, since only two patients at a time could be transported via the skids placed outside each helicopter, this meant that the treatment that each patient received during transport was limited. Evacuation by air undoubtedly was a main factor in the significant reduction in the mortality rate of wounded soldiers during the Korean war conflict as compared with previous conflicts. \\n          \"),_c('br'),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"\\n          Although the idea of triage is not new during the Korean War, there was substantial modification to the concept during the conflict. Triage was instituted at battalion aid stations which were small medical units that had limited capabilities. These stations were capable of supporting up to 1,000 soldiers. Here, general medical officers and nurses evaluated a soldier’s condition and wound severity. Patients needing surgery and all critical patients were rapidly evacuated to the MASH by helicopter. They were further evaluated based on their hemodynamic status and injury. Injuries deemed most critical were prioritized for surgery (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650 - 651). Owing to the huge casualty influx at most if not all MASH hospitals, there was a need to efficiently allocate resources to where it is needed most. This meant that patients considered to unlikely survive were managed expectantly.

Before the Vietnam War, patients whose conditions were unstable were transfused whole blood. While this was effective in managing the condition for some patients, it was not entirely foolproof. Acute renal failure occurred to 0.5% of frontline casualties and needless to say, such a condition in this rough and unforgiving setting resulted in high mortality rates of about 80% to 90% despite immediate care. To combat this, anesthesiologists started using minute amounts of narcotic for induction. Chloroform and ether were also discontinued as anesthetics as it was found to be detrimental to the patients health due to their negative inotropic effects and replacing chloroform and ether was nitrous oxide used Other anesthesia that was recommended for use by MASH units were Thiopental for induction and Tubocurarine and succinylcholine for rapid intubation. \\n\\n        \")])])],1),_c('b-row',[_c('b-col',{staticClass:\"next-slide-container\",attrs:{\"cols\":\"8\",\"offset\":\"2\"}},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"next-slide-text\"},[_c('h4',[_vm._v(\"MASH Living Conditions\")]),_c('br'),_vm._v(\"\\n\\n          The popular 1970s M*A*S*H television series was based off Richard Hooker's experience during his time as a surgeon in the Korean War.

Owing to their close proximity to the fight, they had to do more than regular nurses - from duties such as blood transfusions, administering antibiotics, triaging and suturing of wounds. They even treated civilians caught in the crossfire. Sufficient to say, a MASH unit would not be complete without its nurses. Living near the front meant that every comfort which women were thought to need had to be forsaken. They had to make do with oversized male army fatigues and boots, rough living conditions and a highly stressful workplace. However, these women were not the faint of heart for they have undergone three years of gruelling training in nursing school and graduated with the rank of lieutenant or captain (W. L.

As MASH units were usually located close to the frontlines, personnel were in no less danger from enemy raids as compared to frontline combat units.\n            <br><br>\n            The term MASH was made famous in movies and the subsequent television series M*A*S*H which depicts life at the fictional 4077th that is loosely based on the 8055th. \n\n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4>Evolution of Battlefield Medicine</h4><br>\n\n            The Korean War saw many firsts. Major advancements in casualty transport and medical procedure occurred during the war. Evacuation by air was initially in the Air Force’s sphere of responsibility as they used large cargo planes to transport patients to the rear. By the start of the Korean War, helicopters or ‘air ambulance’ were introduced and favoured for its quick and relative ease of casualty transportation from the frontlines. The Bell H-13 was the main helicopter used for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) as it was the first certified helicopter. Nicknamed the ‘Angel of Mercy’, the Bell H-13 was responsible for evacuating some 18,000 United Nations casualties (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650) . However, since only two patients at a time could be transported via the skids placed outside each helicopter, this meant that the treatment that each patient received during transport was limited. Evacuation by air undoubtedly was a main factor in the significant reduction in the mortality rate of wounded soldiers during the Korean war conflict as compared with previous conflicts. \n            <br><br>\n            Although the idea of triage is not new during the Korean War, there was substantial modification to the concept during the conflict. Triage was instituted at battalion aid stations which were small medical units that had limited capabilities. These stations were capable of supporting up to 1,000 soldiers. Here, general medical officers and nurses evaluated a soldier’s condition and wound severity. Patients needing surgery and all critical patients were rapidly evacuated to the MASH by helicopter. They were further evaluated based on their hemodynamic status and injury. Injuries deemed most critical were prioritized for surgery (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650 - 651). Owing to the huge casualty influx at most if not all MASH hospitals, there was a need to efficiently allocate resources to where it is needed most. This meant that patients considered to unlikely survive were managed expectantly. If patients require specialised therapy such as dialysis and neurosurgery, they were then evacuated to specialty centers further back from the front line.\n            <br><br>\n            Triaging at MASH units was modeled after the dictum: \"Life takes precedence over limb, function over anatomical defects.\" \n            <br><br>\n            In the course of saving lives comes with improvements in areas such as anesthesia and perioperative care. These improvements were based on the collective ground staff experience various MASH units. The practise of resuscitating casualties with crystalloid was not formally implemented until the Vietnam War (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 652). Before the Vietnam War, patients whose conditions were unstable were transfused whole blood. While this was effective in managing the condition for some patients, it was not entirely foolproof. Acute renal failure occurred to 0.5% of frontline casualties and needless to say, such a condition in this rough and unforgiving setting resulted in high mortality rates of about 80% to 90% despite immediate care. To combat this, anesthesiologists started using minute amounts of narcotic for induction. Chloroform and ether were also discontinued as anesthetics as it was found to be detrimental to the patients health due to their negative inotropic effects and replacing chloroform and ether was nitrous oxide used Other anesthesia that was recommended for use by MASH units were Thiopental for induction and Tubocurarine and succinylcholine for rapid intubation. \n\n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4>MASH Living Conditions</h4><br>\n\n            The popular 1970s M*A*S*H television series was based off Richard Hooker's experience during his time as a surgeon in the Korean War. Living conditions depicted in the series appeared harsh and spartan. That depiction was far from reality and settling conditions in an actual MASH unit were far worse. MASH personnel had to endure extremely low temperature and live off the rugged Korean mountainous terrain (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 652). As MASH units were assigned to infantry divisions, they had to move multiple times each month to keep up with the advancing combat units. Medical staff worked around the clock to treat and care for the large casualty influx while surgeons operated continuously with little rest. In fact, it comes as no surprise that some MASH units had a monthly admission of close to over 3,000 casualties. In other words, 200 bed MASH units often had to treat 400 patients per day. The close proximity at which MASH was located, sometimes just 10 miles behind the front lines, made them vulnerable to artillery bombardment and enemy attacks. These were the conditions that MASH staff endured for the most part of 1950 and 1951 (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 652). By late 1953, with the war winding down, only six MASH units were left in Korea and they were re-tasked to provide treatment for prisoners of war (POW) and civilian casualties. \n\n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4>Depiction of MASH in Popular Culture</h4><br>\n\n            The popular 1970s M*A*S*H television series was based off Richard Hooker's experience during his time as a surgeon in the Korean War.

When the television series was aired, many viewers were confused as to why women were involved during the war. Though they were not directly participate in combat, these brave women were the closest to the fighting front in the history of America and they saved countless lives during their service (Cowdrey, 1987, p. 130). Owing to their close proximity to the fight, they had to do more than regular nurses - from duties such as blood transfusions, administering antibiotics, triaging and suturing of wounds. They even treated civilians caught in the crossfire. Sufficient to say, a MASH unit would not be complete without its nurses. Living near the front meant that every comfort which women were thought to need had to be forsaken. They had to make do with oversized male army fatigues and boots, rough living conditions and a highly stressful workplace. However, these women were not the faint of heart for they have undergone three years of gruelling training in nursing school and graduated with the rank of lieutenant or captain (W. L. Whitefrom, 2005, p. 67).\n            <br><br>\n            Apart from external inconveniences and rough living conditions, the nurses also had to take care against the patients that they are taking care of. Wounded soldiers would often attempt to harass the nurses and this was so much an issue that sentries had to be posted each night outside the nurse's tent for protection. However, that is not to say that the nurses could not take care of themselves. Ironically, most of these nurses outrank most of the men harassing them.\n            <br><br>\n            By the end of the Korean War, an estimated 1,500 nurses served their tours of duty in the Korean peninsula. These nurses went on to receive 9 Legions of Merit, 173 Commendation Ribbons and 120 Bronze Star, an impressive feat that exemplifies their courageous and selfless work during the course of their service (Tortorice, 2017).\n\n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4>Evolution of Battlefield Medicine</h4><br>\n\n            The nature of modern warfare and advances in technology has resulted in MASH units to be broken into smaller and more agile medical units. These medical units are now capable of travelling to the front lines to stabilize casualties after a battle before sending them to the rear for proper treatment. This greatly improves the chances of survival of a casualty as he no longer has to spend valuable time waiting to be transported. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) for example has a comprehensive multi layer battlefield management system. This five step system ensures that casualties are taken care of at every possible juncture and maximises the chances of survival and recovery.\n            <br>\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>1. Frontline Combat Medic</div>\n            The frontline combat medic is the first point of contact for a casualty. He is trained and equipped with various medical equipment like chest seals and intravenous fluids to keep the casualty alive in the field before the casualty reaches the next point of contact. The combat medic also conducts triage in conjunction with the company medic. The company medic manages all combat medics. Each rifle platoon has a frontline combat medic attached.<br>\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>2. Battalion Casualty Station (BCS)</div>\n            The BCS is a mobile field hospital installed atop a 5 tonner truck and is equipped with Advanced Trauma Life Support. It’s job is to care for all casualties that the battalion sustains after a mission. The BCS is capable of an intake of roughly ____. Each battalion has a BCS attached.<br>\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>3. Medical Company/Mobile Surgical Team</div>\n            These surgical units in the field are capable of performing damage control surgery within two hours of sustaining heavy injury. These units have an operating theatre that is modular and high dependency unit. Each brigade has a Medical Company attached.\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>4. Combat Support Hospital (CSH)</div>\n            The CSH is run by specialists from multiple disciplines and is made up of mobile containers and tents that can be scaled and are climate-controlled. Signal telecommunications allows for medical information to be exchanged between teams in the field and specialists in the CSH so that the specialists know what to expect when the casualty is received. The CSH has similar functions with MASH.\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>5. Base Hospital</div>\n            Hospital staff is in charge of the casualty treatment and rehabilitation upon arriving at the base hospital.\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>6. Land & Aeromedical Evacuation</div>\n            All combat ambulances are equipped with the necessary life sustaining, communication and navigational systems onboard as it transfers the casualties between each stage of care. Casualties that are critically wounded are evacuated straight to the CSH via the Chinook CH-47 helicopter. The Chinook has the Air Mobile Life Support Unit II installed onboard and it allows flight medics to perform Intensive Care Unit-type procedures and monitoring during transportation.\n\n
