Here, general medical officers and nurses evaluated a soldier’s condition and wound severity. Patients needing surgery were rapidly evacuated to the MASH by helicopter.

MASH personnel had to endure extremely low temperature and live off the rugged Korean mountainous terrain (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 652). As MASH units were assigned to infantry divisions, they had to move multiple times each month to keep up with the advancing combat units. Medical staff worked around the clock to treat and care for the large casualty influx while surgeons operated continuously with little rest. In fact, it comes as no surprise that some MASH units had a monthly admission of close to over 3,000 casualties. In other words, 200 bed MASH units often had to treat 400 patients per day. The close proximity at which MASH was located, sometimes just 10 miles behind the front lines, made them vulnerable to artillery bombardment and enemy attacks. These were the conditions that MASH staff endured for the most part of 1950 and 1951 (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 652).

When the television series was aired, many viewers were confused as to why women were involved during the war. Though they were not directly involved in combat, these brave women were the closest to the fighting front in the history of America and they saved countless lives during their service (Cowdrey, 1987, p. 130). Owing to their close proximity to the fight, they had to do more than regular nurses - from duties such as blood transfusions, administering antibiotics, triaging and suturing of wounds. They even treated civilians caught in the crossfire. Sufficient to say, a MASH unit would not be complete without its nurses. Living near the front also meant that every comfort which women were thought to need had to be forsaken. They had to make do with oversized male army fatigues and boots, rough living conditions and a highly stressful workplace. However, these women were not the faint of heart for they have undergone three years of gruelling training in nursing school and graduated with the rank of lieutenant or captain (W. L.
