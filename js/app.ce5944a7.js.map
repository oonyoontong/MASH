Major advancements in casualty transport and medical procedure occurred during the war. Evacuation by air was initially in the Air Force’s sphere of responsibility as they used large cargo planes to transport patients to the rear. By the start of the Korean war, helicopters or ‘air ambulance’ were introduced and favoured for its quick and relative ease of casualty transportation from the frontlines. The Bell H-13 was the main helicopter used for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) as it was the first certified helicopter. Nicknamed the ‘Angel of Mercy’, the Bell H-13 was responsible for evacuating some 18,000 United Nations casualties (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650) . However, since only two patients at a time could be transported via the skids placed outside each helicopter, this meant that the treatment that each patient received during transport was limited.

Triage was instituted at battalion aid stations which were small medical units that had limited capabilities. These stations were capable of supporting up to 1,000 soldiers. Here, general medical officers and nurses evaluated a soldier’s condition and wound severity. Patients needing surgery were rapidly evacuated to the MASH by helicopter. They were further evaluated based on their hemodynamic status and injury. Injuries deemed most critical were prioritized for surgery (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650 - 651). Owing to the huge casualty influx at most if not all MASH hospitals, there was a need to efficiently allocate resources to where it is needed most. This meant that patients considered to unlikely survive were managed expectantly.

Before the Vietnam War, patients whose conditions were unstable were transfused whole blood. While this was effective in managing the condition for some patients, it was not entirely foolproof. Acute renal failure occurred to 0.5% of frontline casualties and needless to say, such a condition in this rough and unforgiving setting resulted in high mortality rates of about 80% to 90% despite immediate care. To combat this, anesthesiologists started using minute amounts of narcotic for induction. Chloroform and ether were also discontinued as anesthetics as it was found to be detrimental to the patients health due to their negative inotropic effects and replacing chloroform and ether was Nitrous Oxide.

The key to a good ‘bug out’ or retreat was to keep in constant contact with the division they are assigned to.

Though they were not directly involved in combat, these brave women were the closest to the fighting front in the history of America and they saved countless lives during their service (Cowdrey, 1987, p. 130). Owing to their close proximity to the fight, they had to do more than regular nurses - from duties such as blood transfusions, administering antibiotics, triaging and suturing of wounds. They even treated civilians caught in the crossfire. Sufficient to say, a MASH unit would not be complete without its nurses. Living near the front also meant that every comfort which women were thought to need had to be forsaken. They had to make do with oversized male army fatigues and boots, rough living conditions and a highly stressful workplace. However, these women were not the faint of heart for they have undergone three years of gruelling training in nursing school and graduated with the rank of lieutenant or captain (W. L.

Although the effectiveness of his efforts were admired and encouraged by command, there were no attempts to establish formal designation. \n            <br><br>\n            The idea of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) unit was formally conceived by Michael DeBakey. It was to be a better alternative as compared to the random individual portable surgical hospitals and field hospitals systems that was widely used during World War II. Since treatment capability and time are crucial factors for the survival of casualties, the aim was to treat casualties as soon as possible with experienced personnel closer to the front. MASH was designed with that reasoning in mind. The first point of contact of battlefield medical management for casualties was through buddy aid. Casualties were then transferred to Battalion Aid Stations for emergency stabilization surgery and triage, before finally being evacuated to MASH for more extensive treatment.\n            <br><br>\n            <img src=\"https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/02/GettyImages-985232088-1200x1073.jpg\" class='body-image'>\n            <div class='img-tag'>American military surgeons Richard Warren and Roger Wilcox pose beside the sign outside the 8063rd MASH (Mobile Army Surgery Hospital) camp headquarters, in South Korea, April 1952</div>\n            MASH units saw its first major deployment during the Korean war. Since then, they have seen action in every major conflict the US was involved in up until 2003, after which it was replaced by the CSH. Its main mission was to function as a sixty bed surgical hospital. However, in many instances the unit had to assume additional responsibilities of an evacuation hospital without compromising operational efficiency. As MASH units were usually located close to the frontlines, personnel were in no less danger from enemy raids as compared to frontline combat units.\n            <br><br>\n            The term MASH was made famous in movies and the subsequent television series M*A*S*H which depicts life at the fictional 4077th. The 4077th is loosely based on the real life 8055th MASH unit. \n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4><b>Chapter 1: Accounts of Triage and Transportation</b></h4>\n            <div class='episode-tag'>\n              <i>\n              Season 3 Episode 12, A Rich Full Da\n              <br>\n              Season 4 Episode 22, Smillin’\n              </i>\n            </div><br>\n            <img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.defensemedianetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/H-5G-Helicopter.jpg?resize=720%2C577&ssl=1\" class='body-image'>\n            <div class='img-tag'>Casualty being loaded onto the helicopter</div>\n\n            Throughout the series, triage has been a regular scene of which they show patients arriving in jeeps, buses, ambulances and by helicopter. After which, the medical staff would run out to attend to the patients and bring them into Pre-Op. By this time in history, triage would have been well polished as America had adopted it in World War I and kept improving it ever since. The hustle and bustle that they portray during these scenes gave a sense of chaos of the war with patients covered in blood and the doctors and nurses shouting out their injuries over each other.\n            <br><br>\n            There was an episode where the plot was about Captain Pierce narrating to his father back in the US with regards to their day to day business. The first thing he introduced was triage, to which he goes on to give a brief explanation of what it means (M*A*S*H, S03E12, 02:10). This was one of the lighter scenes that was depicted in the series. An interesting point about this episode was the introduction of foreign soldiers that were part of the coalition forces and were also receiving medical treatment from the MASH units. This episode showed a Turkish soldier that was in restraint when he was brought into the hospital (M*A*S*H, S03E12, 02:45). Throughout the episode, he was seen refusing medical treatment and wanted to get back to the battlefield despite having a broken shoulder. He was depicted as rough and wielding a knife threatening everybody who got close to him. He was also unable to communicate in English. In the memoirs of Apel, he mentioned about the Turkish soldiers and their trusty knives (Apel, 1998, p. 61). He also had an anecdote about two wounded Turkish soldiers who had wielded scimitars and refused to hand them over. They were also unable to speak English and the story was similar to the described episode in M*A*S*H (Apel, 1998, p. 121).\n            <br><br>\n            <img :src=\"require('D:/Downloads/Modern East Asian Nexus/fp/src/assets/turkish.png')\" class='body-image'><br>\n            In another episode, there was a scene of how a wounded soldier was prepared at an aid station near the frontlines to be evacuated to the MASH unit (M*A*S*H, S04E22, 01:45). After bandaging him up, they strapped him to the side of a Bell H-13 helicopter and he was flown over to the MASH unit. After which the staff proceeded to dismount the wounded soldier from the helicopter and put him onto the ambulance down to Pre-Op. The true chaos of triage was portrayed later in the episode when there were not only the helicopters bringing in wounded but also ambulances. The doctors were seen doing triage right beside the ambulances and corpsman were setting the wounded just beside them (M*A*S*H, S04E22, 21:10).\n            <br><br>\n            In Apel’s book, he recounted the situation on the ground when the wounded arrived. It was also from multiple vehicular mediums and the unit would be in a frenzied state with the staff all rushing about fulfilling their assigned roles. He mentioned a great deal about how important the helicopters were to the medical effort because of the poor road conditions (Apel, 1998, p. 66). Apel explained about patients being prioritized for evacuation to the MASH units and the procedures the pilot executed to fly and land (Apel, 1998, p. 77). \n            <br><br>\n            <img :src=\"require('D:/Downloads/Modern East Asian Nexus/fp/src/assets/Screenshot (72).png')\" class='body-image'><br>\n            The Korean war saw many firsts. Major advancements in casualty transport and medical procedure occurred during the war. Evacuation by air was initially in the Air Force’s sphere of responsibility as they used large cargo planes to transport patients to the rear. By the start of the Korean war, helicopters or ‘air ambulance’ were introduced and favoured for its quick and relative ease of casualty transportation from the frontlines. The Bell H-13 was the main helicopter used for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) as it was the first certified helicopter. Nicknamed the ‘Angel of Mercy’, the Bell H-13 was responsible for evacuating some 18,000 United Nations casualties (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650) . However, since only two patients at a time could be transported via the skids placed outside each helicopter, this meant that the treatment that each patient received during transport was limited. Evacuation by air undoubtedly was a main factor in the significant reduction in the mortality rate of wounded soldiers during the Korean conflict as compared with previous conflicts. \n            <br><br>\n            Although the idea of triage is not new during the Korean war, there was substantial modification to the concept during the conflict. Triage was instituted at battalion aid stations which were small medical units that had limited capabilities. These stations were capable of supporting up to 1,000 soldiers. Here, general medical officers and nurses evaluated a soldier’s condition and wound severity. Patients needing surgery were rapidly evacuated to the MASH by helicopter. They were further evaluated based on their hemodynamic status and injury. Injuries deemed most critical were prioritized for surgery (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 650 - 651). Owing to the huge casualty influx at most if not all MASH hospitals, there was a need to efficiently allocate resources to where it is needed most. This meant that patients considered to unlikely survive were managed expectantly. If patients require specialised therapy such as dialysis and neurosurgery, they were then evacuated to specialty centers further back from the front line.\n            <br><br>\n            <img :src=\"require('D:/Downloads/Modern East Asian Nexus/fp/src/assets/Screenshot (80).png')\" class='body-image'><br>\n            Triaging at MASH units was modeled after the dictum: \"Life takes precedence over limb, function over anatomical defects.\" \n            <br><br>\n            In the course of saving lives comes with improvements in areas such as anesthesia and perioperative care. These improvements were based on the collective ground staff experience from various MASH units. The practise of resuscitating casualties with crystalloid was not formally implemented until the Vietnam War (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 652). Before the Vietnam War, patients whose conditions were unstable were transfused whole blood. While this was effective in managing the condition for some patients, it was not entirely foolproof. Acute renal failure occurred to 0.5% of frontline casualties and needless to say, such a condition in this rough and unforgiving setting resulted in high mortality rates of about 80% to 90% despite immediate care. To combat this, anesthesiologists started using minute amounts of narcotic for induction. Chloroform and ether were also discontinued as anesthetics as it was found to be detrimental to the patients health due to their negative inotropic effects and replacing chloroform and ether was Nitrous Oxide. Other anesthesia that was recommended for use by MASH units were Thiopental for induction and Tubocurarine and succinylcholine for rapid intubation. \n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n        <b-col cols=8 offset=2>\n          <br><br>\n          <table>\n            <tr>\n              <th>U.S. Conflicts</th>\n              <th>Battle Deaths</th>\n              <th>Wounded in Action</th>\n              <th>Died of Wounds</th>\n              <th>Postevacuation Mortality</th>\n            </tr>\n\n            <tr>\n              <td>World War I</td>\n              <td>50,510 (1.2%)</td>\n              <td>193,663 (4.8%)</td>\n              <td>NA</td>\n              <td>8.5%</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>World War II</td>\n              <td>234,874 (2.0%)</td>\n              <td>565,861 (5%)</td>\n              <td>20,810 (3.7%)</td>\n              <td>4.0%</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n              <td>Korean War</td>\n              <td>27,709 (0.98%)</td>\n              <td>77,596 (2.7%)</td>\n              <td>1,887 (2.4%)</td>\n              <td style='background-color: lightgrey'>2.5%</td>\n            </tr>\n          </table>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4><b>Chapter 2: Bugging out</b></h4>\n            <div class='episode-tag'>\n              <i>\n              Season 5 Episode 1, Bug out\n              </i>\n            </div><br>\n            <img src=\"https://www.mash4077tv.com/images/misc/spotlight/097_bug_out.jpg\" class='body-image'>\n            <div class='img-tag'>Bugging out sequence depicted in M*A*S*H</div>\n\n            As the name implies, the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital must be mobile and readily deployable to keep up with the constantly shifting of the frontlines during the war. While the series was mostly shot at the same location, there was an episode of which the plot revolves around a camp relocation exercise. The episode highlighted the procedures of a typical ‘bug out’ exercise that MASH units had to perform under orders from the headquarters (HQ).\n            <br><br>\n            The exercise begins with Colonel Potter (Commanding Officer) placing Major Burns as second-in-command while he heads off in a Bell 47 MEDEVAC helicopter to scout for a new location that is capable of housing the new MASH unit (M*A*S*H, S05E01, 15:50).\n            <br><br>\n            Before he leaves, he instructs Burns to pack up the unit in a specific order: (M*A*S*H, S05E01, 16:10)\n            <br><br>\n            <b>First Phase</b>\n            <ol>\n              <li>Pharmacy</li>\n              <li>Lab</li>\n              <li>X-Ray</li>\n              <li>Pre-Op</li>\n              <li>O.R.</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            <b>Second Phase</b>\n            <ol start='6'>\n              <li>H.Q.</li>\n              <li>Mess Tent</li>\n              <li>Post-Op</li>\n            </ol>\n\n            After which he takes off to the skies on the helicopter and scouts for a new place to set up the base. Inferring from the scene, it was mentioned that the new base would be located somewhere in between Chin Chon and Chuk San (M*A*S*H, S05E01, 22:20). When he gets back, the convoy is all loaded up and they start to make their way towards the new base. \n            <br><br>\n            <img :src=\"require('D:/Downloads/Modern East Asian Nexus/fp/src/assets/chopper.png')\" class='body-image'><br>\n            There is a scene where it shows Captain Pierce visiting a hut where it was an establishment managed by Koreans that served alcohol and food to the MASH unit. The owner, Rosie, was seen packing up the “bar” alongside her fellow Korean helpers as Pierce enters to grab a drink. It was then when she mentions that they will be moving with the MASH unit to set up her bar at the new location (M*A*S*H, S05E01, 30:30).\n            <br><br>\n            The mobility of MASH is typically misrepresented in popular media and in M*A*S*H. The entire narrative of the series depicts the unit at the same location throughout the war, suggesting that the location of the hospital is permanent (W. L. Whitefrom, 2005, p. 63). In reality, this is only true for short periods of time, with the longest lasting for nearly 4 months. On average, MASH units moved locations 33 times in a year, which is not surprising given the fast changing environment during war. Despite its perceived mobility, moving 100+ MASH personnel, about 400 patients and tons of logistics is no mean feat and still requires foreplanning. The key to a good ‘bug out’ or retreat was to keep in constant contact with the division they are assigned to. For example, if the division was preparing for an offensive, MASH could start stockpiling blood reserves in preparation for a large casualty influx. On the other hand, if the division was dugged in to defend their position, MASH could start packing its non essential logistics early. MASH units were typically expected to ‘bug out’ in 6 hours. \n            <br><br>\n            <img :src=\"require('D:/Downloads/Modern East Asian Nexus/fp/src/assets/Screenshot (67).png')\" class='body-image'><br>\n            M*A*S*H portrayed the ‘bugging out’ sequence accurately. In general, the hospital was split into two sections that took turns in accepting casualties and packing (S.C, Woodard, 2003, p. 509). The order of packing for each section is methodical. The pharmacy and laboratory was first to be packed as these two areas are not as critical in treating patients on the operating table. The X-ray tent is next to be packed and its X-ray equipment loaded up trucks. The receiving tent is collapsed once the last litter enters the operating tent and after the last operation is done, the operating tent is packed. The headquarters, cook and mess tent are loaded up next before finally, the post-op tents are taken down (S.C, Woodard, 2003, p. 509). Soldiers in this last tent would be strapped to anything that would move and taken ahead of the logistics convoy to the next hospital location. \n            <br><br>\n            Other than these inaccuracies in the show, the episode captured and portrayed the procedures of a bug out as according to the memoirs. Everything from the way they dismantled the buildings and loaded up to the vehicles to the way patients were directed and organised unto the ambulances and buses was accurate. It gives the audience a good representation of how it would look like on the ground during a bug out.\n            <br><br>\n            The series also did well to portray the local Korean attaching themselves with the MASH units even as they relocate. These Koreans provide services and provisions to the staff of these MASH units such as food and drinks in order to earn some money to survive. Staying close to these units also kept them safe from the enemy forces. The staff also welcome them as these helps to boost the moral of the staff with some comfort during the war (Apel, 1998, p. 53).\n\n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4><b>Chapter 3: MASH living conditions</b></h4><br>\n            <!-- <div class='episode-tag'>\n              <i>\n              Season 5 Episode 1, Bug out\n              </i>\n            </div> -->\n            <img src=\"http://images.publicradio.org/content/2008/05/21/20080521_mash8063rd_33.jpg\" class='body-image'>\n            <div class='img-tag'>An aerial view of the MASH 8063rd</div>\n\n            The popular 1970s M*A*S*H television series was based off Richard Hooker's experience during his time as a surgeon in the Korean War. Living conditions depicted in the series appeared clean and relaxed. That depiction was far from reality and settling conditions in an actual MASH unit were far worse. MASH personnel had to endure extremely low temperature and live off the rugged Korean mountainous terrain (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 652). As MASH units were assigned to infantry divisions, they had to move multiple times each month to keep up with the advancing combat units. Medical staff worked around the clock to treat and care for the large casualty influx while surgeons operated continuously with little rest. In fact, it comes as no surprise that some MASH units had a monthly admission of close to over 3,000 casualties. In other words, 200 bed MASH units often had to treat 400 patients per day. The close proximity at which MASH was located, sometimes just 10 miles behind the front lines, made them vulnerable to artillery bombardment and enemy attacks. These were the conditions that MASH staff endured for the most part of 1950 and 1951 (Booker & Ismail, 2005, p. 652). By late 1953, with the war winding down, only six MASH units were left in Korea and they were re-tasked to provide treatment for prisoners of war (POW) and civilian casualties.\n\n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4><b>Chapter 4: Women in MASH </b></h4>\n            <div class='episode-tag'>\n              <i>\n              Season 1 Episode 21, Sticky Wicket\n              </i>\n            </div><br>\n            <img src=\"https://www.mash4077tv.com/images/features/nurses_opening11.gif\" class='body-image'>\n            <div class='img-tag'>Opening scene of nurses in M*A*S*H</div>\n\n            There is a brief scene in the opening credits of M*A*S*H that depicts a group of nurses running towards the helicopter pad. When the television series was aired, many viewers were confused as to why women were involved during the war. Though they were not directly involved in combat, these brave women were the closest to the fighting front in the history of America and they saved countless lives during their service (Cowdrey, 1987, p. 130). Owing to their close proximity to the fight, they had to do more than regular nurses - from duties such as blood transfusions, administering antibiotics, triaging and suturing of wounds. They even treated civilians caught in the crossfire. Sufficient to say, a MASH unit would not be complete without its nurses. Living near the front also meant that every comfort which women were thought to need had to be forsaken. They had to make do with oversized male army fatigues and boots, rough living conditions and a highly stressful workplace. However, these women were not the faint of heart for they have undergone three years of gruelling training in nursing school and graduated with the rank of lieutenant or captain (W. L. Whitefrom, 2005, p. 67).\n            <br><br>\n            <img src=\"http://www.koreanwaronline.com/arms/KWjpg/Nurse.jpg\" class='body-image'>\n            <div class='img-tag'>MASH nurses tending to wounded soldiers</div><br>\n            Apart from external inconveniences and rough living conditions, the nurses also had to take care against the patients that they are taking care of. Wounded soldiers would often attempt to harass the nurses and this was so much an issue that sentries had to be posted each night outside the nurse's tent for protection. However, that is not to say that the nurses could not take care of themselves. Ironically, most of these nurses outrank most of the men harassing them.\n            <br><br>\n            <img src=\"http://www.koreanwaronline.com/arms/KWjpg/MashNurse.jpg\" class='body-image'>\n            <div class='img-tag'>A MASH personal scrub in her tent after another day's ordeal</div><br>\n            By the end of the Korean War, an estimated 1,500 nurses served their tours of duty in the Korean peninsula. These nurses went on to receive 9 Legions of Merit, 173 Commendation Ribbons and 120 Bronze Star, an impressive feat that exemplifies their courageous and selfless work during the course of their service (Tortorice, 2017).\n            <br><br>\n\n            <div class='quote'>\n              <img src=\"https://history.amedd.army.mil/ancwebsite/articles/images/quinnwithbaby.jpg\" class='body-image'>\n              <br>\n              “The nurse must be armed to fight just as a soldier, sailor, or marine.

There were of anti-war sentiments and the jokes took a jab at many political and military leaders who were still around. The character of Hawkeye Pierce who was the leading man was seen as one who was very unregimental and liberal. His wit and remarks set the tone for the running themes of the show. The show has a clear agenda by portraying the head character in a good light, with good morals and a sense of liberalism. This is to coerce the audience to view the US participation in wars as unbecoming. It also puts down the military by making a mockery of characters who side strongly with the military and regimentation. \n            <br><br>\n            <b>“Comfort” Ladies</b>\n            <div class='episode-tag'>\n              <i>\n              Season 5 Episode 1, Bug out\n              </i>\n            </div><br>\n            During the episode, the MASH unit was seen to have relocated to a new area to move alongside the changing frontlines. Their new compound had a preexisting building that was planned to be their new operating theater. However, Colonel Potter and Captain BJ were engaged in a heated argument with the headmistress of the building that turned out to be a brothel. They initially refused to vacate the building and when Potter mentioned they are under order from General Irving R. Hamilton, the headmistress recalls him with his nickname “Binky” (M*A*S*H, S05E01, 37:00). Later in the scene they were willing to trade their building for a wardrobe of western dresses.\n            <br><br>\n            <img :src=\"require('D:/Downloads/Modern East Asian Nexus/fp/src/assets/comfortwomen.png')\" class='body-image'><br>\n            The writers took a jab at the military general, inferring that he too had visited these prostitutes on many occasions. They also depicted these Korean prostitutes to have been enjoying their line of work as they were not afraid when they converse with Potter or BJ in their army uniforms. The prostitutes are also seen wearing a mix of western clothing and with pieces of green army tops and hats indicating they have kept leftover pieces of clothing from the soldiers. Lastly, the head mistress spoke with American lingo throughout the conversation and the way they reacted when they saw the dresses portrayed them very “bimbotically “. \n            <br><br>\n            In actual fact, the prostitutes in South Korea were very different from comfort women. After World War II,  the US government established military prostitution in South Korea. After the abolishment of the prostitution under the Japanese colonial rule, the Americans started privatizing prostitution with the US military as their main cilents. These privatised organisation were in fact homegrown and the ladies were treated better than the Japanese (Lee, 2007, p. 453). Even since then, this industry has been maintained past the Korean War with the US soldiers as their main customers. The US government supported the industry because they needed to keep the needs of their military personal in check and to also manage the health standards of the prostitutes. This is to prevent the spread of sexual transmitted dieseaes (Sang-hun, 2009).\n            <br><br>\n\n            <b>A Different Side Of The Enemy</b>\n            <div class='episode-tag'>\n              <i>\n              Season 5 Episode 1, Bug out \n              </i>\n            </div><br>\n\n            The plot of this particular episode was about the Chinese making an offer to swap POWs because their medical facilities were incapable of treating the captured American soldiers. Once again, Captain Pierce displayed his morality when he prioritized a critically injured Chinese soldier over the other wounded American soldiers. The scene took place in a bus where Major Burns was in charge of triage but despite having a large number of incoming wounded, he chose to send in American soldiers into the operating room with minor injuries. Captain Pierce stepped out of the operation room to confront Burns when he found many critically injured Chinese on the ambulance being held back as they lost their priority for treatment thanks to Burns who reminded Pierce that the enemy is to be treated last (M*A*S*H, S03E02, 08:05).\n            <br><br>\n            <img :src=\"require('D:/Downloads/Modern East Asian Nexus/fp/src/assets/chinese.png')\" class='body-image'><br>\n            Later in the episode, they boarded a bus filled with the Chinese POWs to meet up at Rainbow Bridge for the exchange. At the bridge, Pierce started conversing with the Dr Lin Tan, leader of the group of Chinese soldiers when he remarked that Dr Tan spoke very good English. It was then we learn that Dr Tan studied at the University of Illinois. Dr Tan mentions that US planes harassed him night and day while he tries to treat his own wounded people (M*A*S*H, S03E02, 21:15). The whole scene depicts the Chinese soldiers as civilised people willing to make a civilised gesture of swapping POWs just to save lives because of their inadequate medical facilities. This humanises the enemy, making the audience feel that they are fighting their own as Dr Lin had previously studied in the US and spoke English.\n            <br><br>\n            <img :src=\"require('D:/Downloads/Modern East Asian Nexus/fp/src/assets/enemylast.png')\" class='body-image'><br>\n            The only few officially recorded POW exchanges did not detail anything about well educated english speaking Chinese such as Dr Tan but from the records, the treatment of POWs are terrible. Accounts mentioned that the POW camps are grim but the allies are treated better than the South Korean prisoners (BBC, 1953). While the writers of the show wanted to portray a civilised view of the Chinese, known records show otherwise.\n\n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4><b>6: Modern Day Battlefield Medicine</b></h4><br>\n            \n            Much has changed since the Korean War. The nature of modern warfare and advances in technology has resulted in MASH units to be broken into smaller and more agile medical units. These medical units are now capable of travelling to the front lines to stabilize casualties after a battle before sending them to the rear for proper treatment. This greatly improves the chances of survival of a casualty as he no longer has to spend valuable time waiting to be transported. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) for example has a comprehensive multi layer battlefield management system. This five step system ensures that casualties are taken care of at every possible juncture and maximises the chances of survival and recovery.\n            <br><br>\n\n            <img src=\"https://www.mindef.gov.sg/web/wcm/connect/pioneer/2dc73bee-0525-42b0-8b09-df6c586f304f/NOV_2017_p11_graphic.jpg?MOD=AJPERES\" class='body-image'>\n            <div class='img-tag'>Illustration of modern-day battlefield casualty management</div><br>\n            <div class='ls-header'>1. Frontline Combat Medic</div>\n            The frontline combat medic is the first point of contact for a casualty. He is trained and equipped with various medical equipments like chest seals and intravenous fluids to keep the casualty alive in the field before the casualty reaches the next point of contact. The combat medic also conducts triage in conjunction with the company medic. The company medic manages all combat medics. Each rifle platoon has a frontline combat medic attached.<br>\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>2. Battalion Casualty Station (BCS)</div>\n            The BCS is a mobile field hospital installed atop a 5 tonner truck and is equipped with Advanced Trauma Life Support. The right side of the BCS is catered for casualties who have sustained life threatening wounds or Priority 1 (P1) where there will be 2 Medical Officers on standby to perform on the spot surgery while the left side of the BCS is catered to casualties with serious wounds. It’s job is to care for all casualties that the battalion sustains after a mission. The BCS is capable of an intake of roughly 40 casualties. Each battalion has a BCS attached.<br>\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>3. Medical Company/Mobile Surgical Team</div>\n            These surgical units in the field are capable of performing damage control surgery within two hours of sustaining heavy injury. These units have an operating theatre that is modular and high dependency unit. Each brigade has a Medical Company attached.\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>4. Combat Support Hospital (CSH)</div>\n            The CSH is run by specialists from multiple disciplines and is made up of mobile containers and tents that can be scaled and are climate-controlled. Signal telecommunications allows for medical information to be exchanged between teams in the field and specialists in the CSH so that the specialists know what to expect when the casualty is received. The CSH has roughly similar functions as MASH.\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>5. Base Hospital</div>\n            Hospital staff is in charge of the casualty treatment and rehabilitation upon arriving at the base hospital.\n\n            <div class='ls-header'>6. Land & Aeromedical Evacuation</div>\n            All combat ambulances are equipped with the necessary life sustaining, communication and navigational systems onboard as it transfers the casualties between each stage of care. Casualties that are critically wounded are evacuated straight to the CSH via a Chinook CH-47 helicopter. The Chinook has the Air Mobile Life Support Unit II installed onboard and it allows flight medics to perform Intensive Care Unit-type procedures and monitoring during transportation.\n\n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"next-slide-text\">\n            <h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4><br>\n\n            M*A*S*H lasted 11 seasons across 11 years on air. While the show was meant to be a comedy with satire, there were many episodes throughout its run that featured the darker times of war. The show was also aired during the time of the Vietnam war so some of its content had to be managed because it cannot be seen as a protest to the war. It was well known that the director and writers disguised their mockery of America’s role in the war under the cover of comedy. The show had high ratings because many people could relate to it, especially those who have participated in them before. The final episode held the record for the highest percentage of homes with televisions to watch a television series. As compared to today, having a television in the house during the 1970s to 1980s was not as common. \n            <br><br>\n            The portrayal of these MASH units were as authentic as possible. The production team researched extensively in order to recreate the set to mimic the actual MASH units in Korea. Most of the episodes were based on recounts from the men and women in the Korean war and the writers sought help from historians and advisors in the military to create their content. For a television series to be produced in such a way back in the days when technology was not advanced and the internet did not exist, it was a commendable effort by the production crew in attempting to recreate the scenes.\n            <br><br>\n            Today's military battlefield casualty management procedure has come a long way since the rudimentary personal mobile aid station in WW2. The fast evolving nature of modern warfare as well as a shift of emphasis to urban combat has highlighted the need for a small and highly mobile medical team at the ready for casualty management. The formation of the BCS and CSH addresses these needs and ensures that the casualty is cared for at every junction through the efficient allocation of medical resources. Modern day battlefield medicine has come a long way since its inception during the Korean war and is expected to improve in the years to come. \n            \n          </div>\n        </b-col>\n      </b-row>\n\n      <b-row>\n        <b-col cols='8' offset = '2' class='next-slide-container'>\n          <div class=\"references\">\n            <h4>References</h4><br>\n\n            <b>[1]</b> K, Booker & J, Ismail (2005).
